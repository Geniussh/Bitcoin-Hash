# Bitcoin-Hash
This project implements both __SHA-256__ and __Bitcoin Hashing__. 

[SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) is a Secure Hash Algorithm that uses a hash function computed with eight 32-bit words. It is a cryptographic method of converting input data of any kind and size, into a string of fixed number of characters. 

In the case of Bitcoin, a _Message_ is inputted, and a hash function, known as the SHA-256 above, gives an output known as a _Hash_ or _Message Digest_. In particular, I implemented Bitcoin hashing using parallel computing. 

Both were efficiently implemented and gave a charming cycle number.

More details can be found in the [Report](Misc/Project_Report.pdf).
